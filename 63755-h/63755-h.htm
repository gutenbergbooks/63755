WORDS<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON</span><br />
THE CRYSTAL PALACE QUESTION.</h2>
<p>No Clergyman who values his own ease will write on either side
of a question connected however remotely with that of Sunday
observance.&nbsp; If he takes the one side, the world accuses him
of bigotry: if the other, his brethren stigmatize him as a
Latitudinarian.&nbsp; What is worse, he runs the risk of either
furnishing a handle to the irreligious, or perplexing and
depressing the thoughtful and serious.</p>
<p>Nor is the danger removed by his occupying a position of the
utmost possible moderation, acknowledging the strength of both
sides, and endeavouring to adjust with <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>all evenness their conflicting
claims.&nbsp; The only result is, that he becomes the prey of
both parties: each holds on its way, and the voice of candour is
silenced by the uproar.</p>
<p>Yet the truth must be spoken.&nbsp; No personal considerations
ought to suppress it.&nbsp; No anxiety for the cause of good can
justify a timid compromise with error.</p>
<p>It is impossible to reflect without a sense of deep disquiet
upon the present position of the Sunday question in
England.&nbsp; It is a point on which men&rsquo;s professions are
at war with their conduct.&nbsp; It is a point on which
traditional ideas are held in forced conjunction with altered
practices.&nbsp; It is a point on which Christian teachers will
not speak out.&nbsp; It is a point on which popular
prepossessions are accepted as a convenient fact, even where they
are felt to rest on insufficient grounds, and to lead to a most
inadequate result.</p>
<p>And what is the consequence?&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s consciences are
perplexed.&nbsp; They ask&mdash;and there is no audible
answer&mdash;Why do I observe the Sunday?&nbsp; Is it on the
ground <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>of
the Mosaic commandment?&nbsp; If so, who has relaxed the
strictness of its terms?&nbsp; Where is the permission to do,
what we all do, but what Israel did not, on the Sabbath
day?&nbsp; Who taught us that in this one instance the Christian
rule of keeping the spirit of God&rsquo;s commandments implies
the licence to break the letter?</p>
<p>Questions such as these are left to answer themselves as they
can.&nbsp; There remains a large amount of Sabbatical observance:
but it is associated with no little bondage of spirit in what is
done, and with no little embarrassment of conscience in what is
left undone.</p>
<p>And where, meanwhile, is the Christian teacher, wise enough
and bold enough to proclaim from his pastoral watch-tower the
yoke with which Christ has bound us, the liberty wherewith He has
made us free?</p>
<p>Where is he who can encounter, even as St. Paul encountered
it, the obloquy which assails in every age the exaltation of the
everlasting Gospel, as, not the summary merely, not the expansion
merely, not the interpretation merely, but the <span
class="GutSmall">END</span>&mdash;in <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>every sense of that term&mdash;of
every earlier Dispensation? who ventures to declare that not the
fourth Commandment only, but the whole Decalogue, has ceased to
be, <i>as such</i>, the rule of our life? that, although
Christians commit neither idolatry nor murder nor perjury, it is
not because God forbade these crimes by Moses, but because they
are contrary to the spirit of Christ? that, in short, their
obedience to the unchangeable precepts of God&rsquo;s moral Law
is a homage rendered not to Sinai but to Calvary; so that, if in
any point they find in their own Gospel a limitation or a
modification or an extension of any earlier enactment, they are
conscious of no embarrassment in the regulation of their
allegiance&mdash;forasmuch as the later is <i>their</i> law, even
as the earlier was that of others?</p>
<p>And thus with reference to the observance of the Sabbath, and
to every point of moral duty, the appeal lies now, primarily to
the Scriptures of the New Testament, and secondarily to any other
records which we may possess of the practice of the Apostolical
age.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Nor can
it be pretended, when the question is fairly examined, that the
perpetuation of the Jewish Sabbath is either enjoined, or by
implication encouraged, in the words or the writings of the first
disciples and Apostles of our Lord.</p>
<p>How shall we account for the total omission, amidst precepts
so multiplied upon every point of Christian duty, of all
reference to the obligation of the Sabbatical rest?&nbsp; From
whom, if not from the Apostles, could the Gentile Christians
derive their knowledge of its existence?&nbsp; Yet no direction
is anywhere to be found for its observance, nor yet any reproof
for the neglect of it.&nbsp; In the only passages in which a
clear reference to it occurs in the Epistles, the language
employed is that either of indifference to its retention, or even
of rebuke for its revival.</p>
<p>We do indeed find traces in the New Testament of the existence
of <i>another</i> day of weekly observance; a day on which the
disciples came together to break bread; on which it was natural
to collect their offerings; to which (before the last of the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Apostles was
called to his rest) was already appropriated the title of the
Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>But that this day was neither identical with the Jewish
Sabbath, nor substituted for it by any formal act of transfer, is
sufficiently proved by the remarkable circumstance, that there
were in the primitive age Churches in which <i>both</i> were
observed&mdash;Saturday in remembrance of the Mosaic Sabbath,
Sunday in commemoration of the Redeemer&rsquo;s
resurrection.&nbsp; By what right shall we assume that, when the
former observance died out, the latter was invested with its
distinctive attributes? or that, in congregations where the
former had never been practised, the latter had been, all along,
synonymous with an institution with which (to judge from existing
records) they had never been made acquainted?</p>
<p>Then, if this be so; if the Sabbath is an ordinance of the
past; one of those &ldquo;elements or rudiments of the
world,&rdquo; those &ldquo;shadows of things to come,&rdquo; of
which &ldquo;the substance and the reality is Christ;&rdquo; in
what sense do we still read in our Churches the fourth
Commandment, and <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>pray for grace to incline our hearts to keep it?</p>
<p>How low and slavish a spirit is betrayed in this anxiety to
have an express <i>law</i> to show for our Christian
Sunday.&nbsp; How opposite to that which is the distinctive
feature of the Christian character&mdash;an earnest desire to
catch every intimation, every indication, of our Master&rsquo;s
will, that we may do it not as His slaves but as His
children.&nbsp; Enough if we found even a <i>human</i>
institution, which testified throughout Christendom, by a
speaking sign, by an act at once self-denying and beneficent, our
faith in realities unseen and future.&nbsp; Even <i>this</i>
would bind us to its observance.&nbsp; It would be an ordinance
of God&rsquo;s Providence for us.&nbsp; It would be our duty to
submit to it, if it were but an ordinance of man, for the
Lord&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; And surely it would bear upon its very
front the impress of a will more than human: it would bespeak
itself the creation of a Divine philanthropy.&nbsp; He who should
presume to trifle with it&mdash;still more, he who should seek to
abrogate or to nullify it for his neighbours or his <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>countrymen&mdash;would be seen, even if this were all,
to be fighting against God.</p>
<p>But this is <i>not</i> all.&nbsp; We think that we see
indications, from the very earliest days of which the Scriptures
contain the record, of man&rsquo;s need of a periodical rest, and
of God&rsquo;s purpose to secure it to him.</p>
<p>We believe that it is essential to the wellbeing of his bodily
and mental structure.&nbsp; That it is adapted to the
preservation of his health, to the prolongation of his life, to
the comfort and efficiency of his work, whether manual or
intellectual.&nbsp; That the man who regards every day as equal,
who refuses to observe the day of relaxation, will work the worse
while he does work, and decay and die the sooner.&nbsp; That the
man who rigidly abstains from labour and from excitement during
every seventh day, will be a healthier and a happier man for this
intermission, more serviceable and longer lived.&nbsp; And all
this we believe to have been foreseen by man&rsquo;s Creator, and
provided for by the Disposer of man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Thus far, however, we have stopped short of the highest
considerations.&nbsp; If no other <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>purpose were answered by the
institution of the Christian Sunday, it is undeniable that the
<i>nature</i> of the periodical rest might be left wholly to the
individual taste and judgment.&nbsp; It would be a matter of
indifference&mdash;a matter with which conscience would have no
right to intermeddle&mdash;whether it were to be spent in
seclusion or in society, in worship, in novel-reading, or in
travelling.</p>
<p>But we believe, further, that the periodical rest which is
essential to the health of man&rsquo;s body and to the vigour of
man&rsquo;s intellect, is yet more so to the wellbeing of his
immortal spirit, to his education for that state in which earthly
life issues.&nbsp; Surrounded by ten thousand influences drawing
his heart downwards and enchaining his interests upon earth, he
needs the opportunity which God&rsquo;s Providence has thus
afforded him, of cultivating the thoughts and practising the
habits which alone can survive death and occupy his everlasting
energies.&nbsp; Without the recurrence, at brief and regular
intervals, of his day of spiritual improvement, his soul would be
as incompetent <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>to withstand the fascinations of earth, as his body to
endure perpetual exercise, or his mind incessant application.</p>
<p>And when we thus transfer the basis of Sunday observance from
the region of law to that of privilege and blessing; when we
accept as God&rsquo;s gift to us, for certain high and beneficent
purposes, what once perhaps we regarded as a badge of subjection
and servitude; how simple, comparatively, becomes every question
which can affect its observance&mdash;how easy the statement, in
words at least, of the principle which should guide our use of
it.</p>
<p>The question now is, not, What is it lawful, what is it wrong,
to do on the Sunday? how can I so employ it as to avoid breaking
God&rsquo;s Law and incurring God&rsquo;s displeasure? but
rather, How can I derive from it all possible good? how can I
turn to the best account, for myself and others, in soul and
body, the blessing which God has thus conferred upon me?</p>
<p>And shall those who look back through long years upon their
frequent failures to improve this blessing, see no reason for the
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>confession
which bewails their past neglect of it, and the prayer which asks
help to honour it hereafter?</p>
<p>Whatever tends to refresh the mind and body without the
stimulus of an undue excitement, will be, in itself, a desirable
occupation for the Christian Sunday.</p>
<p>But, if this relaxation of the body and mind be attended with
no corresponding benefit to the soul; still more, if it involve
an excitement unfavourable to the remembrance of God, so that, at
the end of the day, Heaven shall be more distant than at its
beginning; then that relaxation has been of a mistaken and
injurious kind; the purposes of the institution have been this
day rather defeated than answered; it is not so much that we have
broken a law, as that we have missed a blessing; we have been
unthankful for a great privilege, we have thrown away a great
opportunity of good.</p>
<p>All this is plain enough as respects an individual: few will
gainsay its truth.</p>
<p>But we are now concerned rather with the <i>national</i>
observance of the Sunday.&nbsp; <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>How are we to apply these principles
to the case of <i>others</i>? more especially, if the question be
one of government, of legislation?</p>
<p>Let us, in the first place, take clearly into view what can,
and what cannot, be done by legislation on such a subject.</p>
<p>It is quite idle to suppose that a Christian use of the Sunday
can ever be secured by authoritative enactment.&nbsp; We cannot,
by all the legislation in the world, augment by one the number of
the worshippers in our Churches; we cannot open one Bible, we
cannot elicit one prayer, we cannot awaken in one heart the
feelings of faith or hope or love.&nbsp; The observance of the
Sunday, as it rests not on law as its basis, so neither can it
rest on legislation for its enforcement.</p>
<p>What then <i>can</i> be done?</p>
<p>Legislation can <i>protect</i> the observance of the
day.&nbsp; It cannot prevent him who will from desecrating it, in
his heart, in his house, in thought, word, or act.&nbsp; But it
can limit the operation of this desecration upon others.&nbsp; It
can refuse to him the <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>absolute command of the services of
others in effecting this desecration.&nbsp; It can coerce within
somewhat narrow bounds his power to keep others waiting upon his
amusements to the loss of the privileges of the day for
themselves.&nbsp; It can say, Such and such places shall be
inaccessible on that day; such and such means of conveyance
withdrawn; such and such servants of the Public excused from
their attendance.</p>
<p>And, besides its protective power, legislation has also a
strong <i>negative</i> operation.&nbsp; There are barriers which
can only be removed by its assistance.&nbsp; At all events, its
interposition may at any moment be invoked to stop such a
removal.&nbsp; It may impede the extension of Sunday travelling:
it may refuse its licence to the multiplication of Sunday
amusement: it may refrain from sanctioning the creation of those
haunts and rendezvous of public attraction which make just the
difference oftentimes between neglect and contempt, between
disregard and defiance, between indifference and
desecration.&nbsp; It is one thing to know that a <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>multitude of
individuals, however numerous, fail to honour the day; another,
to parade before the eyes of the world the legalization of that
failure.</p>
<p>In what manner then do these remarks bear upon the particular
subject now before us; the design (as it is commonly understood)
of opening to the Public during certain hours of the Sunday some
portions of the Crystal Palace?</p>
<p>I have no sympathy with an outcry founded in whole or in part
upon what appears to me to be an untenable notion of the nature
of our Christian Sunday.&nbsp; And I confess that I could forgive
a Statesman who should receive on the present occasion with deep
suspicion the remonstrances of men who but three years ago
fostered and aggravated the same outcry on a plea which the
slightest examination would have shown to be fallacious.&nbsp;
Those who have lent themselves in former instances to swell the
chorus of an ignorant and fanatical clamour, have no claim to
attention now but that with which the actual merits of their case
may furnish them.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>But the
two occasions are, as I believe, widely different.&nbsp; The
contrast is unimportant: I will come at once to the present.</p>
<p>And let me admit, once for all, that it is with things <i>as
they are</i> that we have to do; not with things as they
<i>might</i> exist in a totally opposite condition.&nbsp; We must
take the state of the poor man as it is, and the state of Sunday
observance as it is.&nbsp; We might <i>wish</i> indeed that both
were widely different.&nbsp; We might form to ourselves the
picture of a poor man&rsquo;s Sunday, such as in rare instances
we have seen it: the clean though humble dwelling, the early
prayer of the household, the open Bible, the walk to Church, the
one comfortable meal of the week, the holy and loving converse of
the evening, the prayer and the blessing with which the day ended
as it began.&nbsp; And we might say, and say with truth, that,
for a family thus resting in holy union throughout its weekly
festival of Christian devotion and thankfulness, no change could
come that were not for the worse.&nbsp; No want is here felt of
anything which God has not given: enough for that happy home is
the <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>change
which Sunday has brought with it over the aspect of every
familiar object; the rest from labour, enjoyed with those dearest
on earth, in the remembrance of One loved above all&mdash;this is
all that they ask&mdash;more would destroy it.</p>
<p>But this, alas! is a spectacle as rare as it is beautiful: we
may wish for a theoretical good, but we must choose the
practical.&nbsp; Next below the case just pictured, stands that
of him whose piety perhaps is less fervent, his desire for
relaxation less easily satisfied, and who, thirsting for one
glimpse of nature, one breath of God&rsquo;s air, one ray of
God&rsquo;s sunshine, must seek them where they can be found,
must travel, in short, in quest of them.&nbsp; Shall we pass upon
this man a sentence of harsh, of unqualified, censure?&nbsp;
Shall we say that he who carries with him on the Sunday his wife
and his children to some quiet country spot where he may shake
off the distractions of business, refresh himself with the sights
and sounds of freedom, and pray with his family in a Church less
dark and less dank than he could find in the neighbourhood of his
dwelling&mdash;shall we <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>say that this man breaks God&rsquo;s
Law, and does despite to His holy day?&nbsp; Let others record
this sentence&mdash;I dare not.</p>
<p>But this I would say&mdash;that a freedom which he takes ought
not to be made a yoke of bondage to another; that this liberty of
his, so refreshing (if it be enjoyed in a Christian spirit) to
soul and body, must be purchased for him at as small a cost as
possible of Sunday toil on the part of others: let not the
necessity which he feels, for entire relaxation on his day of
rest, entail upon the servants of the Public a burdensome load of
labour on a day of which they perhaps equally need the enjoyment:
let the protective hand of legislation, if it be necessary, be
interposed to regulate the hours and the method of his coming and
going, that others may rest as well as he.</p>
<p>And, further, I would urge that it is essential to the
beneficial effects of this indulgence, that it should be enjoyed,
as far as may be, in tranquillity and retirement; that it is one
thing to travel on the Sunday to a country village, and another
to be immersed in the bustle and excitement of a <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>crowded fair;
that that quietness of mind and feeling, which is one of the main
blessings of a Christian Sunday, is necessarily impaired if the
scene of relaxation be a focus of popular attraction, involving
the visitor, without the possibility of escape, in the noise and
the glare of a tumultuous assembly.</p>
<p>Nor, once more, could I regard as a matter of indifference the
authoritative bisection of the Sunday into a morning of worship
and an afternoon of pleasure.&nbsp; Whatever be the character of
the day, it is one, not twofold.&nbsp; It is indeed one of the
chief duties&mdash;perhaps the chief ostensible duty&mdash;of the
day, to attend its public services, but we have no warrant for
representing its character as changed when the first or even the
second of those services is ended: whatever it be&mdash;whether a
day of devotion, or a day of inaction, or a day of
amusement&mdash;that it is throughout: and, however little it may
be designed, the effect of the proposed distinction would
assuredly be, not so much to increase the sanctity of the morning
as to destroy that <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>of the evening.&nbsp; Henceforth the claims of
<i>evening</i> worship,&mdash;and still more the claims of the
whole day upon a thoughtful and serious spirit,&mdash;would be
materially disparaged: so far as the effects of this measure
extend, they will cause the day to close at noon: and what will
it be thenceforth to those countless thousands of our countrymen
who are debarred by absolute necessity from attending the service
of the morning?</p>
<p>I know it may be urged that such arguments presuppose the
existence of a very different state of Sunday observance from the
present; that the question really lies not between the Crystal
Palace and the Church, but between the Crystal Palace and the
street or the gin-shop.&nbsp; I believe, however, that no gallery
of painting or of sculpture will have any abiding attractions for
the class thus described: tastes so brutish will not be
transformed by any such expedient: they will remain what they
are, until a mightier engine shall bear upon them: no display of
art will allure them to civilization.&nbsp; The class really
affected by the change proposed will be <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>that already
described; neither the highest of all, nor the very lowest.&nbsp;
Those who now travel on the Sunday in a desultory manner will
then be found congregated in large numbers upon a single point:
and the alteration, so far as it extends, will be for the
worse.</p>
<p>It remains only to assert with all earnestness the
<i>importance</i> of the contemplated innovation.&nbsp; It is the
first step in a course which lies already as in a map before
us.&nbsp; The opening of one such building is virtually the
opening of all.&nbsp; The demand for this extension may be
gradual; but, whenever and wherever made, it must be
granted.&nbsp; At all events, the principle is gone.&nbsp;
England becomes like other nations.&nbsp; That great spectacle of
reverence for God which was afforded last year in the face of
assembled Europe can be presented no more.&nbsp; The very
building which bore so noble a testimony is itself a year later
to utter a different language.&nbsp; Yet where, practically, is
the distinction between the two cases?&nbsp; What Sunday was,
Sunday is.&nbsp; If it was an act of becoming reverence to close
the <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Great
Exhibition on that day, how is it that what was religion then is
superstition now?&nbsp; Assuredly the effects, for good or evil,
of such a proceeding will not be less striking or less extensive
now than then: then too they would have been temporary, now they
will be permanent.</p>
<p>If there be yet time to pause&mdash;and there <i>is</i> time,
for Parliament, at all events, has not yet spoken&mdash;may it be
seized and used.&nbsp; It is one thing for an individual, or a
host of individuals, to disregard or to abuse their day of rest:
it is another thing for the <i>nation</i> to interpose to
sanction that neglect, and thus to fling away by her own act a
badge which, once lost, can never be resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We the undersigned venture to express to your Lordship
with all deference the regret with which we have heard of an
intention to open to the Public on the Sunday (with some
limitations) the new Crystal Palace at Sydenham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We deem it unnecessary for our present purpose to enter
into any discussion of the general question of Sunday
observance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are far from desiring to see such an observance of
the day as would rob it of any portion of its character as a day
of refreshment and of Christian commemoration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can sympathize to the full in the <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>hard lot of
those whose whole week is spent in confinement and toil, and to
whom Sunday alone brings the opportunity of seeing the light or
breathing the air of freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we value above all price that national recognition
of the existence of God, and of the blessings of Christianity,
which has been made for so many ages by this country in its
maintenance of the observance of our weekly day of rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should lament the sanction, by a Royal Charter, of a
departure from the principle of this observance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We consider the concentration of Sunday travelling upon
a single focus of attraction, to be a far greater evil than the
more desultory pursuit of health and relaxation at present
practised by the lower orders on that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we should feel that the noble example of national
regard for the Sunday, displayed last year before the eyes of
Europe in the closing of the Great Exhibition on that day, was
ill followed up by giving a public sanction to an opposite
practice in the case of a building which <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>professes to
be intended to perpetuate the same magnificent design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For these reasons, we beg leave most respectfully to
express our hope that the power now entrusted to the hands of
your Lordship may not be employed in the accomplishment of a
project which we believe in our hearts to be unfavourable to the
Christian character of the nation.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
